Gaming room software design document
//Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
   The gaming room wanted to build a web based game application that could be enjoyed by a large audience no matter the OS they were using. Some of the software requirements were that the program needed to pull 
   from a large pool of stock images that would be loaded in the span of 30 seconds while the players try to guess what the image is. Also, the users and teams needed unique names so ebryone can be easily identified. 
   The last requirement was that only one instance of the game was allowed ro exist in memory. 
   
//What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
   What I did well on this project was doing the reseach and identifying the differernt development requirements for the different OS.
   
//What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  What made the design document useful while working on developing code was that it was all organnized already, so when coding you could go back and know where you are in the process and what needs to be done. 
  making the process faster. 
  
//If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
   If I could go back and revise a part of the document it would be the design constraints, this is because while I did learn about some design constraints and development patterns I would like to grasp the concept further. 

//How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
   The users needs is one of the most important components that need attention to detail. This is because as a a developer you want the customer to get exactly what they need to and are paying for. 
   If corners are cut or users needs are ignored it could result in a poorly performing application that is not suited for the users functionalities. 

//How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
   The strategies introduced in this course for developing code are the design document and UML diagrams. These seem helpful especially when designing a complex applications that could take weeks or months to develop. 
   I will be using these strategies in the future because they can be used to develop in any language, if you are following the UML and design document you can stay on track and weeks or months from now look back and still know
   what you were trying to design.
